## Azure Landing Zone Framework

The Azure Landing Zone framework provides a set of guidelines and best practices for setting up a secure, scalable, and well-managed Azure environment. It includes:

- **Identity and Access Management**: Implementing Azure Active Directory for identity management and role-based access control (RBAC) for resource access.
- **Networking**: Designing a hub-and-spoke network topology with Azure Virtual Network, subnets, and network security groups.
- **Resource Organization**: Structuring resources using management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and naming conventions.
- **Security and Compliance**: Applying security policies, monitoring, and compliance checks using Azure Policy, Azure Security Center, and Azure Monitor.
- **Governance**: Establishing governance practices with Azure Blueprints, cost management, and tagging strategies.
- **Automation and DevOps**: Utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, Azure DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

This framework helps organizations to quickly set up and manage their Azure environments following industry best practices.

## Best Practices

- **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Define and manage your infrastructure using code to ensure consistency and repeatability.
- **Implement RBAC**: Use role-based access control to limit access to resources based on user roles.
- **Monitor and Log**: Enable monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of your resources.
- **Apply Security Policies**: Use Azure Policy to enforce security standards and compliance requirements.
- **Automate Deployments**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of your infrastructure and applications.
- **Regularly Review and Update**: Continuously review and update your infrastructure and policies to adapt to changing requirements and best practices.
