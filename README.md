## Azure Landing Zone Framework

The Azure Landing Zone framework provides a set of guidelines and best practices for setting up a secure, scalable, and well-managed Azure environment. It includes:

- **Identity and Access Management**: Implementing Azure Active Directory for identity management and role-based access control (RBAC) for resource access.
- **Networking**: Designing a hub-and-spoke network topology with Azure Virtual Network, subnets, and network security groups.
- **Resource Organization**: Structuring resources using management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and naming conventions.
- **Security and Compliance**: Applying security policies, monitoring, and compliance checks using Azure Policy, Azure Security Center, and Azure Monitor.
- **Governance**: Establishing governance practices with Azure Blueprints, cost management, and tagging strategies.
- **Automation and DevOps**: Utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, Azure DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.

This framework helps organizations to quickly set up and manage their Azure environments following industry best practices.
